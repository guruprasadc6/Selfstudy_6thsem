# Stockopedia

Stockopedia is an application to display historical stock prices of popular tech companies. It also has a page where predicted stock rates are being displayed.
Highly interactive and dynamic plots are done using Highcharts JavaScript based APIs.

This project was done as an attempt to understand JavaScript based Web Programming and machine learning in a deeper level, as well as get an intuition about the financial markets.
